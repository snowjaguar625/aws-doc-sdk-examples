aws-doc-sdk-examples
####################

This repository contains AWS SDK examples used in the public `AWS documentation repositories
<https://www.github.com/awsdocs>`_.

About the examples
==================

The SDK examples are organized by programming language. For instance, all of the examples for the
`AWS SDK for Java Developer Guide <https://www.github.com/awsdocs/aws-java-developer-guide>`_ are
kept in the `java <java>`_ directory.

Building and running examples
-----------------------------

Within each of the language-scoped directories, you'll find a **README** file that explains how to
build and run the examples contained within it.

The example code itself is present in the ``example_code`` subdirectory, and is organized further by
the AWS service abbreviation ("s3" for `Amazon S3 <https://aws.amazon.com/s3>`_ examples, and so on).


How examples are used in the documentation
==========================================

Examples are automatically included within each developer guide by ``build_docs.py`` (present in
each documentation project), which clones this repository and then copies files from the appropriate
``example_code`` directory into the ``doc_build`` directory prior to building.

Within a guide's source-files, examples are referenced using Sphinx's `literalinclude
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/markup/code.html#includes>`_ directive. For example::

   .. literalinclude:: example_code/s3/src/main/java/aws/example/s3/CreateBucket.java
      :lines: 43-50
      :dedent: 8
