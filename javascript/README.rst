AWS SDK for JavaScript
######################

These are examples for the AWS SDK for JavaScript public documentation.

Prerequsites
============

To build and run these examples, you'll need:

- Node.js 
- AWS SDK for JavaScript downloaded and extracted somewhere on your machine
- AWS credentials in a local AWS credentials JSON file named ``config.json``

Running the examples
====================

To run the examples, you'll need to copy your local credentials file into the same directory
as the example files. For more information about how to set up your local credentials file,
see `Loading Credentials in Node.js from a
JSON File<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-json-file.html>`_
in the *AWS SDK for JavaScript Developer Guide*.

The Node.js examples are all run from the command line.
