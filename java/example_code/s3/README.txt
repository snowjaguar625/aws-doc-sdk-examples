AWS S3 Examples
###############

Prerequsites
============

To build and run these examples, you'll need:

* Apache Maven (>3.0)
* AWS SDK for Java (downloaded and extracted somewhere on your machine)

Building the examples
=====================

To build, go to the directory with ``pom.xml`` in it and type::

    mvn package

It will download the dependencies it needs for building.

Running the examples
====================

To run the examples, you'll need the AWS SDK for Java libraries in your CLASSPATH. You can set them
directly, such as::

    export CLASSPATH=/path/to/aws-java-sdk/lib/*:/path/to/aws-java-sdk/third-party/lib/*

Where ``/path/to/aws-java-sdk`` is the path to where you extracted the AWS Java SDK download (it
should contain the ``lib`` and ``third-party/lib`` directories).

You can then run it like this::

    java aws.example.s3.ListBuckets -cp target/s3examples-1.0.jar:$CLASSPATH

I've included a ``bash`` script that you can run on most systems that assumes you've set the path to
the Java SDK directory in the ``JAVA_SDK_HOME`` environment variable. For example::

    export JAVA_SDK_HOME=/path/to/aws-java-sdk

Once you've set the variable, you can execute ``run_example.sh`` as shown::

    ./run_example.sh ListBuckets

and it will run the ListBuckets example (assuming that you've built the examples first!).
